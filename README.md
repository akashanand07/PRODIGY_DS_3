# PRODIGY_DS_3
This task is to create a decision tree model that predicts if a customer will buy a products or service using demographic and behavioral data, such as in the Bank Marketing dataset.

This project builds a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on demographic and behavioral data.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset

Source:Bank Additional CSV

Contains customer details such as:

Age, job, marital status, education

Contact type, previous campaign outcomes

Number of contacts during the campaign, duration of last contact, etc.



ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib, Seaborn


ðŸš€ Steps Implemented

1. Data Loading & Exploration â€“ Understanding the dataset structure.


2. Data Preprocessing â€“ Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling data if needed.


3. Train-Test Split â€“ Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets.


4. Model Training â€“ Using DecisionTreeClassifier from Scikit-learn.


5. Model Evaluation â€“ Accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report.


6. Visualization â€“ Plotting the decision tree and feature importance.



ðŸ“Š Output

Predicts Yes or No for product/service purchase.

Useful for targeted marketing and customerÂ segmentation
